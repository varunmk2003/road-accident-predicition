# road-accident-predicition
in this project we have built an web application which will predict the possible number of accidents that  can happen in the next financial year by using the dataset of the current years accident  data
here i have used dataset provided by NHAI and have used two algorithms mainly SVM and CNN .
using these two algorithms the model predicts the number of accident that can happen in 10+ cities and 5+ types of accidents with an acccuracy of 95%
